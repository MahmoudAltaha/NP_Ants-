# NP_Ants
 This project was a part of the requirments to pass the Concurrent Programming lecture at Saarland University.
 
 The origin structure of the project (all classes in shared file + the main Methode in "Simulator.java") was provided for us from the Professor's team.
 My job was to implement the cuncurrent behavior ( i created and implemented all classes outside "shared file" )
 
 
 you can find the project description in "Projectbeschreibung.pdf"
 you can find some details of how i implemented the cuncurrent behavior in "Meilenstein Omega(update).pdf"
